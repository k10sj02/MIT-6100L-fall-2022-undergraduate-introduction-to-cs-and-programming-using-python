## MIT 6.100L (Fall 2022) – Introduction to CS and Programming Using Python

This repository contains code from MIT’s 6.100L (Fall 2022) – Introduction to Computer Science and Programming Using Python, taught by Dr. Ana Bell. The course introduces fundamental programming concepts using Python, focusing on problem-solving through computation. It is designed for students with little to no prior programming experience.

I’m using this material to strengthen my Python foundations in preparation for upcoming projects this year.
